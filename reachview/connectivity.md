## Wi-Fi

To add a Wi-Fi network click on the blue plus sign, enter your Wi-Fi credentials and click create. 

To switch to hotspot mode click on “start hotspot” button.

During power up Reach will search for known Wi-Fi networks and if it does not see any create a hotspot. 

!!! Tip
    If you want to make Reach create hotspot every time, you should delete all Wi-Fi networks from the list. It is not possible to delete the network that you are currently connected to, so you will  need to switch Reach to hotspot mode. After switching to hotspot and connecting to it you will be able to delete all Wi-Fi networks and Reach will always start in hotspot mode.



## Bluetooth

When Bluetooth is on it is constantly scanning for other devices. To pair your smartphone or PC with Reach make your device discoverable. Once your device appears in the "discoverable" section, click on it to send a pairing request. Accept the pairing request on your device. Your device will appear as paired.

ReachView supports a secure pairing protocol, which extends the range of supported devices. Reach and Reach RS support integration with Windows CE-based collectors.
