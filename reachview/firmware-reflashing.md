## When to reflash the firmware

On this page you will find the information on how to reflash Reach firmware.
Please note that you don't need to do this unless you want to bring Reach to its initial state or new firmware image version is released. If your Reach has ReachView version 0.4.9 it is necessary to reflash it with new firmware image in order to receive updates and support.

Most new features are released via ReachView app updates that can be updated simply by pressing an "Update" button in its interface.
